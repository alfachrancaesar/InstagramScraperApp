  For the architecture for this assignment, we used the the IgramScraper to scrap the data from Instagram. Then, we combined the scraper with _Flask Rest API_ to deploy the data in JSON file and hosted it in web service. After that, we used _Restrofit_ for Android Client to pass the data into the Android App.
